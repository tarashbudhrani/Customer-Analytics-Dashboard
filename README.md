# E-commerce Sales & Customer Analytics Dashboard

## Overview
This project focuses on building an end-to-end analytics dashboard for e-commerce business reporting. It tracks key performance metrics such as Customers, Orders, Sales, Average Order Value (AOV), and inactive customers over the last 12 months to support data-driven decision-making.

## Tech Stack

- SQL
- Python
- Tableau

## Key Highlights

- Analyzed **category sales contribution** using conditional formatting to highlight **top vs low performing categories** for faster decisions.
- Performed **churn analysis (YoY)**, **market basket analysis**, and **delivery vs review analysis** to support **retention** and **cross-sell strategies**.

## Business Questions Answered
- Which customer segments are becoming inactive over time?
- Which categories contribute the most/least to overall sales?
- What products are frequently purchased together (cross-sell opportunities)?
- How do delivery performance and customer reviews impact satisfaction?
